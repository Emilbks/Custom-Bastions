# Custom-Bastions
A program for a custom TTRPG Bastion system

## Design Principles
- There should never be any always optimal choice (both on a turn by turn basis and a bastion building basis).
  - This includes there not being enough room for all features in a room.
- It should be interesting to run, not a chore.
- It needs to reward players for their time effort and money spent.
- Get GenAI out of creative decisions.
