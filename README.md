# Custom-Bastions
A program and content+ruleset for a custom TTRPG Bastion system.

## Design Principles
- There should never be any always optimal choice (both on a turn by turn basis and a bastion building basis).
  - This includes there not being enough room for all features in a room.
- It should be interesting to run, not a chore.
- It needs to reward players for their time effort and money spent.
- Get GenAI out of creative decisions.

## Suggesting Changes
Any suggestions to additions, changes, and removals of bastion content should be done through a pull request and never pushed directly to main by anyone but @Emilbks.
