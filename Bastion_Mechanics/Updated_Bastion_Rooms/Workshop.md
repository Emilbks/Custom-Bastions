## Perks
*The Assistent.* The workshop employs a hireling who has proficiency in Arcana and is great at helping others make items. The hireling is able to assist you in crafting items so long as you are the one leading the craft. If you yourself lack the proficiency in Arcana needed to make magical equipment, the hireling is able to make up for it. They are however unable to be in charge of a craft on their own.

## Actions
*Assisting Assistent.* When station room features are added to this room, *The Assistent* can be ordered to assist one of them during a bastion turn. During this turn, the other hiring will have a helper to speed up the process.
