You can add an additional room inside the closet's subspace. The room is made when the closet finishes construction and has 20 functional squares pre-built ignoring the regular max. The room cannot be expanded by regular means. The room cannot use any public-facing effects. The room can be replaced over three turns at the cost of 20000 GP. At level 17, you can expand the room to 30 squares for 30000 GP.

#### Perks
*Book Selection.* Select a topic that relates to a skill when you first build this feature and gather a “grade 1” set of books about them. You can change this at the start of a bastion turn for 250 GP and this feature being unavailable during the turn. At the levels 11, 15, and 19 you are able to increase the number of topics and highest grades by 1, up to a max of 4. Each topic has to be bought on their own, but when changing topic, it’s only that Skill that’s lost for the turn and not the entire feature. The grades are priced like this: 1/2/3/4 -> 250 GP/1000 GP/4000 GP/16000 GP

#### Action
*Late-night Studying.* By spending all of your long rests during the bastion turn in your bedroom, you get an increase to your chosen skill’s modifier for the next bastion turn while the knowledge is fresh in your mind. If your long rest does not include at least an hour of quiet activity, then you’ll have to extend your long rest by an hour. The increase to your skill is dependent on the grade of books read with grade 1/2/3/4 -> +2/+4/+6/+8.
